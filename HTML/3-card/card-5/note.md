text-align: center

display: inline-block
-> apply to tag "a"

.card (parent) -> set width (not set height) -> height will be auto set following to card (child)

set "class" to "tag name" to apply css of that "class" to the corresponding "tag name"
for example:
.flex-center -> avoid duplicated code
